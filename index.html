        The Exit - Cornan Gray
    </h3>

    <p>
        February, and the flowers haven't even wilted
It's crazy how fast you tilted
The world that we were busy buildin'
Mid-November, and I'm sippin' on a half-cold coffee
Starin' at a girl who's not me
On your arm, a carbon copy
Feels like we had matching wounds
But mine's still black and bruised
And yours is perfectly fine now
Feels like we buried alive
Something that never died
So, God, it hurt when I found out
You love her, it's over
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (When you say it, say it?)
You love her, it's over
You already found someone to miss
While I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
I can't hate you for gettin' everything we wanted
I just thought that I would be part of it
I was movin' into your apartment
When you met someone, she's from your hometown
You hate the East Coast, it's where you live now
Impossible to understand how you're not comin' back
But I can't say it out loud
You love her, it's over
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (When you say it, say it?)
You love her, it's over
You already found someone to miss
While I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
Feels like we had matching wounds
But mine's still black and bruised
And yours is perfectly fine
Feels like we buried alive
Something that never died
So, God, it hurt when I found out
You love her (feels like we had matching wounds)
It's over (but mine's still black and bruised)
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (And yours is perfectly fine now)
(When you say it, say it?)
You love her (feels like we buried alive)
It's over (something that never died)
You already found someone to miss (so, God, it hurt when I found out)
You love her, it's over

        Traitor - Olivia Rodrigo
    </h3>

    <p>
        Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Brown guilty eyes and little white lies
Yeah, I played dumb but I always knew
That you'd talk to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain't it funny
How you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny
How you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You'd talk to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around
Just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true
There's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
Ain't it funny
All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid?
Ain't it funny?
Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid
You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You'd talk to her
When we were together
Loved you at your worst
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still a traitor
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
(Ah-ah-ah)
When she's sleeping in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way
You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You'd talk to her
When we were together
You gave me your word
But that didn't matter
It took you two weeks
To go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still
You're still a traitor (ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, you're still a traitor
Ooh-ooh-ooh
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you

        Lover - Taylor Swift
    </h3>
        <p> 
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover
        </p>

            Cinnamon Girl - Lana Del Rey

        </h3>
        <p>
            Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss
You're touching me
All the pills that you did
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me
At arm's length don't work
You try to push me out
But I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out
I win
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, I'm fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you leave
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to keep
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you leave
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to keep
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

            Cupid - Fifty Fifty
        </h3>
        <p>
            불 꺼진 romantic, all my life
내 주위는 온통 lovely day
내 눈 속에 비친 arrow sign
(Oh, why? Oh, why?)
(Oh, why? Oh, why?)
I'm feeling lonely (lonely)
그만 힐끗대고 말해줘요
Hold me (hold me)
다시 crying in my room
숨기고 싶어 (say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
또 꿈길을 걷는 every day
눈 뜨면 다시 또 flew away
Waiting around is a waste (waste)
나 솔직히 지금이 편해
상상만큼 짜릿한 걸까?
Now I'm so lonely (lonely)
매일 꿈속에서 연습했죠
Kiss me (kiss me)
다시 crying in my room
포기할까 봐 (say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I'm so lonely, hold me tightly
짜릿한 걸 원해
Who will really love me truly?
내게 기다림은 없어 I can't wait
더는 믿지 않아 now I'm gonna make it mine
Love is a light, I'll show my love is right
It's not a joke, so give it to me right now
No more chance to you
You know? Hey, d-d-d-dumb boy
꿈속에 매일 밤
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool, a fool for love
A fool for love
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid (hopeless girl is seeking)
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid (someone who will share this feeling)
다시 한번 못 들은 척 기회를 줄게 (I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb (a fool for love, a fool for love)
