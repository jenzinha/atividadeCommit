    <h3> 
        The Exit - Cornan Gray
    </h3>

    <p>
        February, and the flowers haven't even wilted
It's crazy how fast you tilted
The world that we were busy buildin'
Mid-November, and I'm sippin' on a half-cold coffee
Starin' at a girl who's not me
On your arm, a carbon copy
Feels like we had matching wounds
But mine's still black and bruised
And yours is perfectly fine now
Feels like we buried alive
Something that never died
So, God, it hurt when I found out
You love her, it's over
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (When you say it, say it?)
You love her, it's over
You already found someone to miss
While I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
I can't hate you for gettin' everything we wanted
I just thought that I would be part of it
I was movin' into your apartment
When you met someone, she's from your hometown
You hate the East Coast, it's where you live now
Impossible to understand how you're not comin' back
But I can't say it out loud
You love her, it's over
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (When you say it, say it?)
You love her, it's over
You already found someone to miss
While I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
I'm still standin' at the exit (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh)
Feels like we had matching wounds
But mine's still black and bruised
And yours is perfectly fine
Feels like we buried alive
Something that never died
So, God, it hurt when I found out
You love her (feels like we had matching wounds)
It's over (but mine's still black and bruised)
Do you even doubt it on your lips? (And yours is perfectly fine now)
(When you say it, say it?)
You love her (feels like we buried alive)
It's over (something that never died)
You already found someone to miss (so, God, it hurt when I found out)
You love her, it's over

            Cinnamon Girl - Lana Del Rey

        </h3>
        <p>
            Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss
You're touching me
All the pills that you did
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me
At arm's length don't work
You try to push me out
But I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out
I win
There's things I wanna say to you
But I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about
But better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, I'm fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you leave
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to keep
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you leave
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to keep
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

            Cupid - Fifty Fifty
        </h3>
        <p>
            불 꺼진 romantic, all my life
내 주위는 온통 lovely day
내 눈 속에 비친 arrow sign
(Oh, why? Oh, why?)
(Oh, why? Oh, why?)
I'm feeling lonely (lonely)
그만 힐끗대고 말해줘요
Hold me (hold me)
다시 crying in my room
숨기고 싶어 (say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
또 꿈길을 걷는 every day
눈 뜨면 다시 또 flew away
Waiting around is a waste (waste)
나 솔직히 지금이 편해
상상만큼 짜릿한 걸까?
Now I'm so lonely (lonely)
매일 꿈속에서 연습했죠
Kiss me (kiss me)
다시 crying in my room
포기할까 봐 (say what you say, but I want it more)
But still I want it more, more, more
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I'm so lonely, hold me tightly
짜릿한 걸 원해
Who will really love me truly?
내게 기다림은 없어 I can't wait
더는 믿지 않아 now I'm gonna make it mine
Love is a light, I'll show my love is right
It's not a joke, so give it to me right now
No more chance to you
You know? Hey, d-d-d-dumb boy
꿈속에 매일 밤
Someone who will share this feeling
I'm a fool, a fool for love
A fool for love
I gave a second chance to Cupid
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid
보여줄게 숨겨왔던 love, is it real?
Cupid is so dumb
I gave a second chance to Cupid (hopeless girl is seeking)
널 믿은 내가 정말 stupid (someone who will share this feeling)
다시 한번 못 들은 척 기회를 줄게 (I'm a fool)
Cupid is so dumb (a fool for love, a fool for love)
